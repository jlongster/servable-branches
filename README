This script takes a mirror of a git repository (git clone --mirror)
and continually updates & publishes each branch into a working
directory on the filesystem. The primary purpose of this is for
serving each branch as a unique website (branch1.site.com,
branch2.site.com, etc.)

Currently, it even creates a web service for each branch so that it
can be served immediately. This makes it depend on <a
href="http://smarden.org/runit/">runit</a>, but it can be generalized
to work with any server setup.
